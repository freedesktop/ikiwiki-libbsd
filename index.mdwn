# libbsd

This library provides useful functions commonly found on BSD systems, and
lacking on others like GNU systems, thus making it easier to port projects
with strong BSD origins, without needing to embed the same code over and
over again on each project.

## License

The licenses for the code contained in libbsd are quite permissive to make
it easier for other projects to use it. Most of the licenses are either
[ISC](https://spdx.org/licenses/ISC.html),
[MIT](https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html),
[Beerware](https://spdx.org/licenses/Beerware.html),
[BSD-2-clause](https://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause.html),
[BSD-3-clause](https://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause.html), and
[BSD-4-clause](https://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause.html) (but only
for few of the man pages, and this is considered a bug). Please check
the the COPYING file and the source code for the actual license details.

## Download

## Development

## Contact

[Mailing list](https://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/libbsd).

The project is being switched to the FreeDesktop.Org GitLab instance, and
Bugzilla has now been disabled, we'll be using the GitLab issues once the
migration has finished. Until then, please feel free to send your reports
to the mailing list.

Historic bugs can be accessed from
[Bugzilla](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/buglist.cgi?query_format=specific&bug_status=__closed__&product=libbsd).
