# libbsd

This library provides useful functions commonly found on BSD systems, and
lacking on others like GNU systems, thus making it easier to port projects
with strong BSD origins, without needing to embed the same code over and
over again on each project.

## License

The licenses for the code contained in libbsd are quite permissive to make
it easier for other projects to use it. Most of the licenses are either
[ISC](https://spdx.org/licenses/ISC.html),
[MIT](https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html),
[Beerware](https://spdx.org/licenses/Beerware.html),
[BSD-2-clause](https://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause.html),
[BSD-3-clause](https://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause.html), and
[BSD-4-clause](https://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause.html) (but only
for few of the man pages, and this is considered a bug). Please check
the the COPYING file and the source code for the actual license details.

## Contact

[Mailing list](https://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/libbsd).

The project has been switched to the
[FreeDesktop.Org GitLab](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/) instance, and
filing new bugs in Bugzilla has been disabled. We are using the GitLab
[issues](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/libbsd/libbsd/issues) now. Historic
bugs can be accessed from
[Bugzilla](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/buglist.cgi?query_format=specific&bug_status=__closed__&product=libbsd).

### Security issues

In case of a security issue that needs to be reported privately, please
send encrypted mail to [Guillem Jover](https://www.hadrons.org/~guillem/),
the current maintainer.

## Contributing

Changes can be sent either as patches to the mailing list, or as
[merge requests](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/libbsd/libbsd/merge_requests).

New interfaces can be added, depending on their portability, and on their
presence on at least one of the BSDs. The preferred form is by importing the
best implementation from one of those BSDs. Alternatively an implementation
from scratch might be required. In that case the preferred coding style is
[KNF](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=style&sektion=9) and a
[BSD-3-clause](https://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause.html) license, but
a more permissive license is also welcome. Any new function must also come
with a man page. Ideally new interfaces should get new unit tests.
